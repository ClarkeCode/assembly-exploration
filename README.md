# Assembly Exploration

Experiments in the ARM instruction set, first following https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-assembly-part-1/

The Godbolt compiler explorer has been a valuable tool https://godbolt.org/

For sample programs which do not produce output, you can determine the value of the R0 register by checking the exit code with:
```
./myprogram ; echo $?
```
